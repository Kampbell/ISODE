To register your organisation in the Directory please provide your
organisation information to your national manager.

Your national manager, (or the Paradise project) will add your
organisation information to the directory and will assign you a
password.  As soon as you receive the notification that your
organisation is now registered, you will be allowed to maintain
the information on your organisation header, as well as to add entries
to your organisation.  

Please change your password as soon as you receive this information
and keep it confidential.  It is a good practice to change your
directory password from time to time.

You will then be responsible for having the information on your
organisation up-to-date.

Information is also available on specific countries.
