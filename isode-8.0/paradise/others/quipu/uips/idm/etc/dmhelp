      This is the general description on how to use the
             Interactive Directory Manager (IDM).

Specific help is available for each prompt by typing ?.  This will
display a message to help you with the specific question you have.

At any point in IDM (except yes or no prompts), you may type `q' to quit
from the operation you are executing.  If you are at the initial menu,
and type `q' again, you will be taken out from the service.

Default values are shown between square brackets []   To accept the default
value, type <CR>.  For example in the prompt
`Enter number or q to quit  [1  List all entries]:  '
Typing <CR> will cause the option 1 (List all entries) to be executed,

If you are in the trouble, typing Cntrl-C will take you to the initial menu
and from there you may exit by typing q to quit.
