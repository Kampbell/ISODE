     Welcome to PARADISE - the COSINE Directory Services

This set of services can help you to:

  -  Enquire the directory for information available.  An easy to follow
     sequence of prompts will help you search the entries for you.

  -  Register in the directory.  If you want to join this pilot, it gives
     you information on how to do it, and how you can contact your
     national manager.

  -  Manage your organisation. Once you have joined the pilot, you may
     use this management tool to enter and keep up-to-date the
     information for your organisation.
