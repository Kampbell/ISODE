The COSINE/PARADISE DUA.  
------------------------

Use 

    ./make all

to compile the DUA.  

Before installing you might want to configure the local terminal type
information to match your system.  To do this run
    
    ./make termhelp

(NOTE: This may not be portable to some System 5 machines).

You should now edit the detailor file in this directory.  The full
list of tailor options is described in the manual.  This just
describes a couple of important ones.

You will probably set this one:
    
    dsa_address:   THE ADDRESS OF YOUR DSA.

Optionally, you might include a second dsa_address line, containing
the address of a backup DSA.

Your are VERY STRONGLY encouraged to set the username.  This is the name
with which the interface binds to the directory.  Don't forget to
create an entry in the directory as appropriate:

    username:@c=GB@o=University College London@cn=Public Access Dua

You'll probably want to configure these for your local organisation:

    default_country: GB
    default_org: University College London

The rest of the settings will probably be OK to start with.  See
the manual for a full discussion of all the tailoring options.


Finally to install, use

    ./make inst-all

To run the interface type

    de

At the ":-" prompt type "?" to read the online help.
