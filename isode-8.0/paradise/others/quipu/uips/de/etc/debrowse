You may be unable to find the entry you are looking for with a 
straight-forward query.  This may be because the entry is named differently 
to what you imagined, or may be an indication that the entry is not in the 
directory.  Browsing the directory may be useful in these circumstances.
The following example gives an example of how to BROWSE.
    person>       kille
    department>   computing science
    organisation> ucl
    country>      gb

The Directory Service returns with the message: "No departments match string 
`computing science'" and prompts for a DEPARTMENT name to be entered.
Entering "*" will list all the DEPARTMENTs within gb, ucl thus:
      1 A.U.T. Office
      2 American Institute for Foreign Study
     27 Computer Science                         etc.

The user can now select one from the list by entering the tag number thus:
    department> 27
and the query should now proceed further.
