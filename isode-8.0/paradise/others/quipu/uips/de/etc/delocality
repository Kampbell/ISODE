This program does not currently allow you to specify a locality within 
which to search for an organisation.  However, if an organisation cannot
be found initially (that is if the organisation does not have a national
registration), a list of possible localities to search will be offered.

Select a locality from this list by typing the number corresponding
to the locality you wish to search.  If the organisation is within that 
locality, the search will continue.  If the organisation entry cannot be 
found within that locality, you will be asked if you wish to search any 
other localities - at present there is no facility to search several
localities simultaneously.
