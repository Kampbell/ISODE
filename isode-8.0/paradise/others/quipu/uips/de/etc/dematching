In many cases, the Directory will be able to resolve queries successfully, 
even if you enter names which do not exactly match the names in the Directory.
However, you may find that the Directory will fail to find a match, which 
appears to be almost correct.  The following query provides such an example:

    person>       kille
    department>   computing science
    organisation> ucl
    country>      gb

In this case, the Directory Service returns with the message: "No departments
match `computing science'", although the correct name of the department,
"computer science", is very similar.  

The reason for this failure is that too much information has been provided 
for approximate matching to work.  In general, the less you type, the more 
matches the system will return.  Thus, entering "comp" at the department
prompt will obtain the following response:

Got the following approximate matches.  Please select one from the list
by typing the number corresponding to the entry you want.

      1 Computer Science
      2 Computerised Tomography

Alternatively, typing "comp sci" will obtain the following matches:

      1 Central Computing Service
      2 Computer Science

You may find that the system will occasionally return some "matches" which 
you find hard to understand - the approximate matching uses phonetics if
more precise matching is not possible.
	    
See the help screen on WILDCARDS for details on how to exercise more control
over the type of matching used by this service.
