UFN stands for user-friendly naming.  The style of querying allows the
specification of the details of the query all in one go.  A few examples
should make usage clear:

   ucl,gb
   p barker,ucl,gb
   goodman,comp sci, univ coll, england
   john, univ los angeles, california, us

Name parts are separated by commas.  Note that you do not have to specify the 
same number of components in each search.  The program tries a variety of
searches to try to match what you have typed with names of Directory entries.
If more than one match is found as the search progresses, you will be asked to
select one entry from a list of possible matches.  Type the number 
corresponding to an entry to select it.  If you don't select any 
from the offered list, you may be offered further names to choose from.
