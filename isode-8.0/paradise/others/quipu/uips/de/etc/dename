Simplest usage is to type the NAME you want.  The following forms are 
suggested:
          Barker           P Barker          Paul Barker
However, often it is unnecesary to specify complete NAMEs.  Typing `Bark' 
will first try and find entries exactly matching `Bark'.  If an exact match 
cannot be found, the program will then match any entries with similar names -
it even tries to cater for mis-spellings.  More control over the matching of 
entries can be achieved by using wildcard characters -  type "? WILDCARDS" 
for usage.  It is also possible to type all the search details - the person's 
name, department, organisation and country name on one line - type "?UFN" for 
usage. Summary of special commands:

*         will list all people in the selected DEPARTMENT or ORGANISATION
<CR>      will accept any default from a previous query.
-         will clear any existing default.  Entering no NAME allows
          querying for information about DEPARTMENTs and ORGANISATIONs.
          Type "? ORGINFO" for more details on how to do this.
