The first field is an NSAP prefix - the longest such prefix match is selected.

The second field is an SNPA binding for implementations that require NSAP/SNPA bindings. If this is not required it may be left as a `-'

represents CONS or CLNS network service. If this field is missing the
default nsap stack specified in the \fIisotailor\fP file is used.
