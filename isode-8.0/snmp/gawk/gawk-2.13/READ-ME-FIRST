0.   You should already have installed the 4BSD/ISODE SNMP software.

1.   Get a copy of GNU Awk 2.13.  Extract the gawk-2.13/ hierarchy into
     this directory, snmp/gawk/gawk-2.13/.

2.   Follow the instructions in the README file to configure gawk, e.g.,

	configure sunos41

3.   Apply the patches to the sources by

	% patch -p < GAWK-PATCHES

4.   Now edit the Makefile which was created in step 2.

     a)    If your $(INCDIR) is not /usr/include, then add to the "FLAGS="
	   definition

		-I$(INCDIR)

     a)    To the "LIBS=" definition, add

		-lisnmp -lisode

     b)    To the "CFLAGS=" definition, add

		-DSNMP -DDEBUG

     c)    To the "AWKOBJS" definition, add

		snmp.o

     d)    To the "SRC" definition, add

		snmp.c

5.   Type 

	% make

     to generate gawk.

6.   As the super-user copy gawk to $(BINDIR) and create the directory
     /usr/local/lib/awk.

7.   At this point you should be able to do a trivial test:

	% gawk -f s-gawk/mib.system

     which will contact your local SNMP agent using the default
     community and ask for information from the system group.  The
     output looks something like this:

	agent cheetah.ca.psi.com
	   running: 4BSD/ISODE SNMP
	            (1.3.6.1.4.1.4.1.2.4)
	  services: applications, end-to-end
	  location: upstairs machine room
	   contact: Marshall Rose <mrose@psi.com>
	    uptime: 5 days, 17 hours, 24 minutes, 37.69 seconds

8.   Now you can install the primarly application supplied, s-netstat:

	# (cd s-gawk; ./make inst-all)
