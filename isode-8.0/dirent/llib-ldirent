/*
 * This package was generously supplied by Doug Gwyn.  It is a public domain
 * implementation of the SVR3 directory access routines.
 *
 * I have slightly edited the package to produce a stand-alone library
 * (normally it updates libc.a).  The reason for this, is that the package
 * is used primarily for ISODE's ftam responder, and it's too much heartburn
 * to ask someone to reload libc.a just for that (sorry, doug!)
 *
 * I've also prepended a "_" to the names to avoid any conflicts with routines
 * which might already be installed (especially for lint)
