    Look at the skeleton files provided to get the flare of things.  In
    addition, when porting to non-standard UNIX variants, consult the
    files h/{general,manifest}.h to find other strange #defines


1. Operating Systems

    Choose one of BSD42, SYS5, or ROS.  In addition, some of these
    have suboptions.

#define	BSD42			Berkeley UNIX
#define	WRITEV			    real Berkeley UNIX (has writev syscall)
#define	SUNOS4			    with Sun's enhancements (SunOS4.0 or later)
#define	SUNOS41			        SunOS4.1
#define	BSD43			    4.3BSD or later
#define	BSD43_Tahoe		        4.3BSD Tahoe release
#define	BSD44			        4.4BSD to be precise! (not out yet)
#define	OSX			    Olivetti's version
#define aiws			    AIX Workstation

#define	SYS5			AT&T UNIX
#define SVR4			    System V Release 4
#define SVR4_UCB		    SVR4 with ucb extensions
#define SHADOW_PW		    Use shadow password file
#define	SVR3			    System V Release 3
#define	HPUX			    SVR2 with HP's enhancements
#define	AIX			    SVR2 with IBM's enhancements
#define	AUX			    SVR2 with Apple's enhancements

#define	ROS			Ridge's emulation of UNIX

#define	VSPRINTF		libc includes vsprintf() and vfprintf ()

#define TEMPNAM			libc has tempnam () calls (use of this
				is much recommended if available)

2.  Network/Transport options 

    Choose any combination of TCP, X25, BRIDGE_X25, or TP4.  For
    TCP:  SOCKETS, WINTLI and EXOS are mutually exclusive, and WIN and BIND are
    suboptions to SOCKETS.  For X25:  SUN_X25, CAMTEC, CAMTEC_CCL, UBC_X25
    and ULTRIX_X25 are mutually exclusive.  

    For TP4: WIN, SUN_TP4 are mutually exclusive.

#define	TCP			support TCP/IP with TP0
#define	SOCKETS			    provided by SOCKETS
#define	WIN			        emulated via WIN/TCP for SVR2
#define	WINTLI			    provided by WIN/TCP STREAMS
#define	EXOS			    provided by EXOS 8044 card
#define	BIND			if BIND is used (the gethostent struct
				    has an h_addrlist field in <netdb.h>)
				you may need to add "-lresolv" to the LSOCKET
				definition in CONFIG.make

#define	X25			support X.25 with TP0
#define	SUN_X25			    using SunLink X.25 version 4.0 or 5.0
#define	SUN_X25_HACK			to enable local subaddress masking 
					(see comments in compat/x25addr.c)
#define	CAMTEC			    using CAMTEC interface
#define	CAMTEC_CCL		    using CAMTEC interface with sockets
#define	UBC_X25			    using UBC X.25
#define UBC_X25_WRITEV		        able to use writev for X.25,
					not all versions of UBC code
					support this.
#define	ULTRIX_X25		    using Ultrix X.25
#define ULTRIX_X25_DEMSA		X.25 access to DEC DEMSA x25router 2000
#define HPUX_X25		    using HP-UX X.25
#define CCUR_X25		    using CCUR X.25

#define	BRIDGE_X25		use a TCP/X.25 gateway (deprecated)
				    (requires #ifdef TCP)
				    will not be part of the next release.

#define	TP4			support real TP4
#define	SUN_TP4			  provided by SunLink OSI
#define	SUNLINK_5_2		      using SunLink OSI release 5.2 or greater
#define	SUNLINK_6_0		      using SunLink OSI release 6.0 or greater
#define	SUNLINK_7_0		      using SunLink OSI release 7.0 or greater
#define	BSD_TP4			 provided by UCB/UWisc
#define TLI_TP			 provided by TLI interface
#define TLI_POLL		      making use of the poll(2) sys call
#define ICL_TLI			      using the ICL DRS6000 TLI interface
#define XTI_TP			 provided by XTI interface

#define	NOGOSIP			assume TSEL uniquely distinguishes service
				    (makes tsapd a LOT smaller and faster)


3. Directory Services

    By default, support for both the OSI Directory and the stub DSE is
    compiled.  However, to enable access to the Directory (via a
    lightweight access protocol), the isotailor variable ns_enabled
    must be turned "on".  If the nameservice fails, then the stub DSE
    will be consulted.

    While not advised at this point you can disable fallback to the stub
    DSE by also choosing NOSTUB.  Disabling the fallback mode implies
    that all name to address resolution will depend on the DSE and will
    fail if it is not operational. 

#define	NOSTUB		do not use stub DSE when resolving names


3.1 X.400 Attribute Syntaxes

#define USE_PP		

    If you have PP (5.3 or greater) you can compile X.400 defined
    attribute syntaxes such as ORAddress into QUIPU.  You will also have
    to add "libpp.a" and "libdl.a" into the LIBDSAP= rule (before
    libdsap.a itself) in your CONFIG.make file, for example

    	LIBDSAP= -L/usr/local/src/pp/Chans/lists -ldl \
		 -L/usr/local/src/pp/Lib -lpp \
		 libdsap.a

3.2 Security Services

#define OSISEC

    If you have the OSISEC security package you can make certain applications
    secure.  You will also need to add "libosisec.a" & "libcrypt.a" to the 

    LIBDSAP= rule (before libdsap.a itself) in your CONFIG.make file, for
    example 

    	LIBDSAP= -L/usr/local/src/osisec-package -losisec -lcrypt  libdsap.a
   
    and indicate the whereabouts of the OSISEC header files by adding
    to the OPTIONS= rule, for example

	OPTIONS= -I. -I$(TOPDIR)h $(PEPYPATH) -I/usr/local/src/osisec-package/h

4. UNIX Directory compatability routines

    If your system supports a getdents() call, then define

#define	GETDENTS

     This will make the directory compatibility library a no-op.
     Otherwise, define one of:

#define	UFS	original UNIX filesystem (14-character name limit)
#define	BFS	Berkeley UNIX filesystem (long names)
#define	NFS	getdirentries() system call


5.  imisc options 

These are used by the imisc daemon to exec the rfinger program.

#define	RFINGER	"path"		where rfinger lives
#define	RFOPT1	"switch"	  switches
#define	RFOPT2	"switch"	  switches


6.  Anonymous login for ftam, etc.

This defaults to

#define	ANON	"ftp"

You can set it to something else if you like.  For example, to have anonymous 
ftam but not anonymous ftp (due to the numerous security holes in anonymous
ftp), then just define ANON to be "ftam" and replace the "ftp" username in
the /etc/passwd file with "ftam" instead.


7. Management Instrumentation

DO NOT SET THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING (i.e., if you had to read
this file, then you shouldn't set this option!)

#define	MGMT	to enable management instrumentation in libtsap


8. PEPSY options

#define	PEPSY_REALS		real support for pepsy
				    add "-lm" to LSOCKET in CONFIG.make


9. KERBEROS options

If you want the FTAM responder to use Kerberos for authentication, you can use
the option below.  If enabled, Kerberos will be enabled if the pw_passwd field
is the three-character sequence "*krb*".

#define	KRB_PASSWD		enable Kerberos checking

You must also add these three lines to your CONFIG.make file

KRBOPT	=	-I<location of Kerberos include directory>
KRBLIB	=	-lkrb -ldes
