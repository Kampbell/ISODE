\chapter{Introduction}


This document contains a set of updates to the version 7 ISODE manual.
This document refers to the final public version of ISODE, released as
ISODE-8.0.  As the changes to the documentation since the 7.0 release
have been only minor, it would be wasteful to reproduce the entire
manual set.

The following chapters contains a description of the changes to
various parts of the ISODE version 7 manual.

Appendix~\ref{ports} includes a table of hardware platforms and
operating systems this version of ISODE is believed to work on.  This
information is based upon reports given to us.  We do not know how
accurate the information is.

\chapter{The ISODE Tailoring file}

This chapter reflects changes to Chapter 6 of Volume 2 ``Tailoring''.

The sub section titled ``Bridge X.25'' has been removed from
Section~6.1.5 ``Interface Specific Tailoring'', reflecting the removal of the
TP0 bridge from the ISODE.  

In the sub section titled ``General X.25 Tailoring'', the text for the
\verb+x25_dnic_prefix+ parameter has been changed to:

\begin{describe}
\item[\verb"x25\_dnic\_prefix"] If you use either or both of the
preceding two mechanisms 
[\verb+x25_intl_zero+ or \verb+x25_strip_dnic+]
then you must use this variable to
inform ISODE of the local DNIC for your host.

It can contain more than one DNIC, this is only relevant if 
\verb+x25_intl_zero+ has the value \verb"on".  
All DNICs in the list will not
have the leading zero added.  This is useful for private X.25
networks (such as the european IXI) that do not need leading zeros.
Only the first DNIC listed will be used in striping.
\end{describe}

Some new sub sections have been added to Section~6.1.5, these are
included below.

\subsubsection{RTnet-X25/PLUS}

X.25 using the Concurrent RTnet-X25/PLUS needs some tailoring as
described below.  
At least one of option must be configured.
  
\begin{describe}
\item[\verb"x25\_default\_line"] RTnet-X25/PLUS requires attached lines to be
            configured with names.  This variable determines which named
            line will be used if an appropriate match is not found in
            x25\_communities (see below).

\item[\verb"x25\_communities"] pairs of community name and line name to 
	    determine which line will be used for a call to a 
	    particular community. 
\end{describe}


\subsubsection{TP4}
\begin{describe}
\item[\verb"nsap\_default\_stack"]
	If the TP4 interface has access to both CONS and CLNS, this
	parameter is used to determine the default.  The value can be either
	\verb"CONS" or \verb"CLNS".
	The default value is \verb"CLNS".
	You should also consult \man isonsapsnpa(5), which defines how
	the default stack can be overridden for specific NSAP addresses.
\item[\verb"local\_nsap"]
	A default NSAP address for tsapd to listen on if the \verb"-N"
	flag is used! 
\end{describe}

\subsubsection{TLI TP4}
The following setting are only useful when TP\_TLI is defined, that is,
the TP4 is provided by the TLI interface.

\begin{describe}
\item[\verb"tli\_cots\_dev"]
	The name of the device node used to access COTS
	(default \verb"/dev/ositpi").
\item[\verb"tli\_clts\_dev"]
	The name of the device node used to access CLTS
	(default \verb"/dev/ositpi").
\end{describe}

\subsubsection{ICL TLI TP4}
When using TLI on an ICL~DRS6000, the following two addressing 
parameters will need setting:

\begin{describe}
\item[\verb"tli\_initiator\_prefix"]
	The subnet name of the network interface to use for outgoing X.25 calls
	(default \verb"x25_tliin").
\item[\verb"tli\_responder\_prefix"]
	The subnet name of the network interface to use for incomming
	X.25 calls. 
	(default \verb"x25_tlire").
\end{describe}

\subsubsection{XTI TP4}
The following setting is only useful when XTI is defined.  That is TP4
is provided by an XTI interface.  XTI is only alpha test in this release.
\begin{describe}
\item[\verb"xti\_tp0\_ident"]
	The string value is the string passed to the XTI interface during
	t\_bind for X121 addresses.
	Default \verb"TOSITP0".
\item[\verb"xti\_tp4\_ident"]
	The string value is the string passed to the XTI interface during
	t\_bind for TP4 addresses.
	Default \verb"TOSITP4".
\end{describe}


\chapter{QUIPU}

This chapter details changes to the Volume 5 manual: QUIPU.

There have been extensive changes to the Chapter 6: DE.  The new
chapter is included in its entirety as Appendix~\ref{DUA:de}.

There is a new Chapter on ``DM tools''.  These are a set of DISH shell
scripts which provide some simple bulk data management functions using
DAP.

Chapter 10 has a new sub section on the SearchACL attribute syntax, 
this is in Appendix~\ref{searchacl}.

Chapter 11 of Volume 5 has a new section describing searcl ACLs in
more detail.  This is included as Appendix~\ref{disc_sacl} of this document.
  
It should also be noted that the {\tt QUIPU-support@cs.ucl.ac.uk} support
address no longer exists.  This has been replaced with a bug reporting
address.  Any changes required will be incorporated into the ISODE Consortium
releases, and not released to the public domain.  

\begin{quote}
{\tt bug-quipu@isode.com\/}
\end{quote}
However, it should be noted that the open discussion list 
\begin{quote}
{\tt quipu@cs.ucl.ac.uk\/}
\end{quote}
does still exists.  Mail 
\begin{quote}
{\tt quipu-request@cs.ucl.ac.uk\/}
\end{quote}
to join the discussion.

\section{Text Changes}

The second paragraph of Section 17.2.1, page 201 in volume 5 should read:
\begin{quote}
The fields \verb"ca_ext", \verb"ca_progress", \verb"ca_requestor" 
and \verb"ca_aliased_rdns" are provided as
they are defined within X.500.  Neither the QUIPU DSA or DUA use these
fields, but they must be initialized to zero.
\end{quote}
  
The text in Section 17.2.2 ``Results'' should read:
\begin{quote}
The field \verb"cr_aliasdereferenced" is set to \verb"TRUE" if the base
object of the operation was an alias, and was dereferenced.

The field \verb"cr_requestor" is the DN of the requestor of the
operation.  It is only used for secure operations.

The other fields are used by {\em pepsy} whilst encoding and decoding
the structure.
\end{quote}

All of the references to \file{.podrc} in Chapter 9 should be replaced
with \file{.duarc}

\chapter{Known Problems}

This chapter describes some known problems with the current
implementation of ISODE.

\subsubsection{Simply Encoded Data}

If ``user-data'' at the presentation layer is simply encoded, ISODE is
sometimes unable to decode the data.  ISODE always uses fully encoded
data.  A default context in not proposed by any of the applications,
thus simply encoded data is rarely required.

\subsubsection{Large RFC-1006 TPDUs}

If RFC-1006 is used to transfer a large TPDU, then the current
implementation effectively does a read of the RFC-1006 header,
followed by \verb+n+ bytes of data, as specified in the header.

If \verb+n+ is large, it will require several reads to 
actually read this number of bytes. These reads are done
synchronously, one after another until the packet is in. However, if
its a large packet and the TCP connection is unreliable, some of the 64K
may get dropped and have to be retransmitted.
If a router goes down also in this time you can get left hanging.
This particularly effects QUIPU.

\subsubsection{ACSE Initialisation}

During the initialisation stage of an ACSE connection, it is possible
for a connect request to momentarily block.

\chapter{ISODE Consortium}
\label{IC}

The ISODE Consortium is a not-for-profit cooperative enterprise, whose
mission is to promote and develop the ISODE package of OSI (Open
System Interconnection) applications, which has been used extensively
in the research community.  The ISODE Consortium will be able to
evolve the ISODE software more rapidly than would be possible for any
single member.  This will be to the mutual benefit of members of the
consortium, and will help to stimulate the market for OSI, which
is key technology to enable open communication between and within
organisations.  Membership of the ISODE Consortium is open to any
organisation in any country.

The ISODE Consortium releases of ISODE will be made exclusively
available to the ISODE Consortium members or by purchase of products
from ISODE Consortium members.  Academic organisations, and not for
profit or government organisations with research as their primary
purpose, will be given zero cost access to the ISODE Consortium releases,
on the basis of simply signing a licence with minimal administrative
overhead. This builds on a major strength of the ISODE package by
facilitating use of ISODE within the research community, whilst
allowing ISODE to evolve as a product base.

The ISODE Consortium has mailing lists for bug reports relating to the
ISODE Package.   These are:

\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{ll}
bug-quipu@isode.com &  -- bugs relating to QUIPU\\
bug-pp@isode.com    &  -- bugs relating to PP\\
bug-isode@isode.com &  -- bugs relating to any other parts of ISODE\\
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

These lists are for the planned ISODE Consortium releases of ISODE.  
Bug reports relating to the ``ISODE-8.0'' release of ISODE are
welcome.   Changes will be incorporated into the ISODE Consortium
releases, and not released to the public domain.
