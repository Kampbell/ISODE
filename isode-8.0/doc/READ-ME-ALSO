If you obtained this version of ISODE via ftp or ftam, then the
document set is not included.  This will be found in a different
file as described by the file COVER-LETTER in the top level
ISODE directory.

The READ-ME file details the documents in the documnet set, and the
file ls-lsR gives a complete list of all document files.
