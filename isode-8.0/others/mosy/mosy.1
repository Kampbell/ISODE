.SH NAME
mosy - Managed Object Syntax-compiler (yacc-based)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.in +.5i
.ti -.5i
.B mosy
\%[\-o\0module.defs]
\%[\-s]
\fImodule.my\fR
.in -.5i
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fImosy\fR program reads a description of a \fImanaged objects\fR
module and produces a simple ascii file containing equivalent definitions.
This file is meant to be read as configuration data by a network
management program.
.PP
The `\-o' switch sets the name of the output file,
which is normally derived from the name of the input file.
The distinguished file \*(lq\-\*(rq can be used to force the use of the
standard output.
.PP
Normally, \fImosy\fR prints the name of each object, identifier, or type
as it works.
The `\-s' switch disables this behavior.

.SH BUGS
The author spends a fair bit of time trying to have \fImosy\fR
accurately both check the official and oral policies of the SMI.
At present,
there are three known deficiencies.
.PP
First,
\fImosy\fR does not maintain a library,
so it can't check IMPORT statements for their validity.
.PP
Second,
\fImosy\fR discards the enumerations associationed with INTEGERs
(though it does range check them).
.PP
Third,
\fImosy\fR doesn't range check size constraints associated with INTEGERs.
