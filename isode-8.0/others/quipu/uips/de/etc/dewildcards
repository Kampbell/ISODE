It is possible to exercise some control over the matching that the interface
does by use of wildcards.  Note that this feature is not fully general.
Five wildcard formats are valid.

*          This will either, depending on the context (see the help screens
           for each input line), search or list all entries of the 
	   specified type.
paul*      Matches entries with a name beginning with the string "paul"
*paul*     Matches entries with a name containing the string "paul"
*paul      Matches entries with a name finishing with the string "paul"
paul*ker   Matches entries with a name beginning with the string "paul"
           and finishing with the string "ker"

Note that the interface automatically provides some wildcard matching if 
no wildcarding is specified but no exact match can be found.  The interface 
will progressively try weaker and weaker matching in an attempt to satisfy
a query.
