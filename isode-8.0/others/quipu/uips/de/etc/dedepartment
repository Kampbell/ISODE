The straightforward usage is to enter the name of the DEPARTMENT where the 
person sought works.  Note that the DEPARTMENT name entered does not have to 
exactly match that in the Directory: e.g. "french" will match "French Language
and  Literature".  WILDCARDS may be used (see the HELP screen for WILDCARDS).
In particular note that:

*         will list all DEPARTMENTS.
<CR>      will accept the previous default DEPARTMENT.  If no default exists,
          <CR> will allow the searching of all DEPARTMENTs.
-         to clear an existing default, and allow searching of all DEPARTMENTs.
control-C to return to the prompt for a person's NAME.
q         to quit the Directory or (optionally) to return to prompt for a 
          person's NAME.

However, the entry of a DEPARTMENT may be considered to be optional.  In the 
case of small ORGANISATIONS, it will be as efficient to search all the data 
as the number of results returned will not be large.  In the case of large 
ORGANISATIONs, it will often be prudent to enter a DEPARTMENT to reduce the 
scope of a search.
