Simplest usage is to type the NAME you want.  The following forms are 
suggested:
          Barker           P Barker          Paul Barker

However, often it is unnecesary to specify complete NAMEs.  Typing `Bark' 
will first try and find entries exactly matching `Bark'.  If an 
exact match cannot be found, the program will then match any entries 
containing the "word" `Bark' - entries for Barker will now be found.  Finally
some approximate matching is attempted - this often caters for mis-spellings.
It is possible to exercise more control over the matching attempted by 
using wildcard characters -  type "? WILDCARDS" for more details on the use 
of wildcards.  Summary of special commands:

*         will list all people in the selected DEPARTMENT or ORGANISATION
<CR>      will accept any default from a previous query.
-         will clear any existing default.  Entering no NAME allows
          querying for information about DEPARTMENTs and ORGANISATIONs.
          Type "? ORGINFO" for more details on how to do this.
