Enter the name of the COUNTRY containing the entry you are seeking.  This 
should either be a long-form name such as "united kingdom" or "great britain",
or one of the two letter country codes ("gb" for the United Kingdom).  If a 
long-form name is used, it is only necessary to enter enough of the name
to unambigiously identify the COUNTRY.  For example, "germ" or "deut" are
sufficient to identify Germany.
