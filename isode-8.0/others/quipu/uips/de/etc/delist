You may be unable to find the entry you are looking for with a 
straight-forward query.  This may be because the entry is named differently 
to what you imagined, or may be an indication that the entry is not in the 
directory.  Make a guess initially, and if there is no entry with the name you
have entered, the program will allow you to list the entries in the
Directory, and adjust the name you have entered.

The following example gives an example of how to do this.

    person>       kille
    department>   networking
    organisation> ucl
    country>      gb

The Directory Service returns with the message: "No departments match
`networking'" and prompts for a DEPARTMENT name to be entered.

To discover the names of departments for which there is information,
entering "*" will list all the DEPARTMENTs within UCL in Great Britain thus:

      1 A.U.T. Office
      2 American Institute for Foreign Study
      . ...
     27 Computer Science
     .. ...
	
The user can now select one from the list by entering the number thus:
    department> 27
and the query should proceed further.

See the help screen on MATCHING for tips on specifying queries.
