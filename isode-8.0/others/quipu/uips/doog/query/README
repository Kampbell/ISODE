	Much of the code in this directory is not required by doog!
	
	This library is still in the development stage.	The final release
	of libQuery will be a full set of services to the X.500 directory,
	including two new methods of searching:

		o User friendly naming
		o Form filled searching

	These search strategies will then be usable by future DUA
	writers who wish to use them but don't want to implement them!

	This library is currently being used by development versions of
	Doog and XLookUp (an X DUA).
