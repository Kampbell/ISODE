Doog pre-beta(!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Doog is an (almost complete) implementation of Steve Kille's
	User Friendly Naming proposal, using asynchronous directory access.
	
	The source in this directory is a pre-release version of doog.
	It has been included in ISODE in order to get some feedback on
	the UFN approach and also as example code using the new
	asynchronous DSAP library.

	Doog is not complete! It is currently short of:
	
		o Help pages
		o Status reporting during searches
		o Configurability of directory reads


COMPILATION
~~~~~~~~~~~
	To compile enter

		./make.

	This should build `xdoog'. To test enter

		./xdoog -test

	which will run doog against the config file `doogrc' found in the
	current directory.

CONFIGURATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Various configure files (config.*) can be found in the source doog
	directory which can replace the standard `doogrc'. These allow the DUA
	to operate in several different `modes'.

	These should be edited to suit your local organization (read
	comments in config file for details).
	
	If you wish to try them out copy `config.whatever' into `doogrc'
	and run

		./xdoog -test

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Doog is installed with

		./make inst-all

	if you want to install and clean up the source directory type

                ./make install
