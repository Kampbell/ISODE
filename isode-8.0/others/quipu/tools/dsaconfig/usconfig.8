.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIusconfig\fR program reads the file \fIwildlife\fR.dsa and
creates a new directory, \fIwildlife/\fR, containing the initial
database for a new participant in the U.S. portion of the DIT. At this
time, \fIusconfig\fR can only be used within the U.S., as it uses
some of the rules for naming that make up the North American Directory
Forum's recommendations on Naming.
.LP
The '-l' option to \fIusconfig\fR produces a list of the legal
names for U.S. states and state equivalents.
.LP
The '-c' option should be used to when creating a configuration for
an organization of national standing that is chartered by the Congress
of the United States.
