This directory demonstates how to start a 
DSA holding a copy of the root EDB

*** STARTING UP ***

The start the DSA type
	/etc/ros.quipu -t ./quiputailor
in this directory.

You should see something of the form...

The DSA is named  "c=GB@cn=Toucan", this was read from the
./quiputailor file in this directory.

First off the DSA loads the database, and finds its own entry in the
c=GB/EDB file, amongst other things, this
defines the presentation address of the DSA (do NOT use the localHost
address as given in the example, this will not work when distributed
to the network as a whole).  Suitable address formats are described in
the ISODE and QUIPU manuals.

The DSA will then load all the other EDB files it can.
The it will write a copy of its own entry to a file called DSA.real.
This is now considered the MASTER copy of the DSAs entry, if you need
to re-edit the DSAs entry, you should modify this file.  The version
in the EDB file is a (possibly out of date) copy.

Finally it will start listening for associations.

To stop all the diagnostic message you should re-direct the output to
a file, for example, start the DSA with (using /bin/csh)

       % /usr/local/etc/ros.quipu -t ./quiputailor >&/dev/null

You will not need to run this is the background as the process will
detach itself from the terminal and control will return to your shell.

*** Configuring your organisation ***

In the following text replace references to c=GB with your own country!

You will also need to add an entry for your DSA is the c=GB/EDB,
similar to the c=GB@cn=toucan entry.

You should modify the o=XX entry to refect your organisation, and
replace the database below o=XX with the data for your organisation

When complete, both these entries should be sent to
the DSA manager of the DSA holding your country as a master copy.
If you can not find out who this is, mail
     helpdesk@paradise.ulcc.ac.uk
who should be able to help.

*** UPDATING SLAVES ***

Having registered your DSA and organisation you will be able to receive
regular updates of the root node and your country node 
of the DIT by setting the variable
   update on
in your quiputailor file.
