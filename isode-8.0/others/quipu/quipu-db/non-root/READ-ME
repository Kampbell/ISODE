This directory demonstates how to start a 
DSA NOT holding a copy of the root EDB

The start the DSA type
	/etc/ros.quipu -t ./quiputailor
in this directory.

You will then see messages similar to...

   dsa name c=GB@o=University College London@cn=toucan
   WARNING - Can't open "./EDB" (2)- should I be able to ?
   WARNING - Can't open "./c=GB/EDB" (2)- should I be able to ?

   DSA c=GB@o=University College London@cn=toucan has started on localHost=17003
   secs: -1; nads: 0; iads 0x0, wads 0x0

At this point the DSA has started.
The DSA is named "c=GB@o=University College London@cn=toucan", and
this entry was read from the c=GB/UCL/EDB file.
You would not expect this DSA to hole the root EDB or c=GB/EDB files,
so the warning messages can be ignored.

The DSA is started on the address defined in 
c=GB/UCL/EDB
(presentationAddress= localHost=17003)

NOTE this DSA only holds data for 
c=GB/o=University College London/ou=Computer Science 
locally, so attempts to read data higher up the tree will cause referrals.
