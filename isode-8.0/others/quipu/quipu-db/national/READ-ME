This directory demonstates how to start the first DSA for a new
country. The DSA is holding a copy of the root EDB, and MASTER of the
new country (c=GB in the example).  The new country has two
organisations, X-Tel Services Ltd, and University College London.  The
data for X-Tel is held in the DSA, the UCL DSA is held in another DSA.

*** STARTING UP ***

The start the DSA type
	/etc/ros.quipu -t ./quiputailor &
in this directory.

You should see something of the form...

       % /usr/local/etc/ros.quipu -t ./quiputailor &

The Sibling file warnings can be ignored UNLESS you would expect the
referenced files to be found (in this case ignore them!)

The DSA name is "cn=Vampire Bat", this was read from the "quiputailor"
file in this directory.  

The first step is to read the "./EDB" file.  In this file there is and
entry for the DSA (the first entry), amongst other things, this
defines the presentation address of the DSA (do NOT use the localHost
address as given in the example, this will not work when distributed
to the network as a whole).  Suitable address formats are described in
the ISODE and QUIPU manuals.

The DSA will then load all the other EDB files it can.
The it will write a copy of its own entry to a file called DSA.real.
This is now considered the MASTER copy of the DSAs entry, if you need
to re-edit the DSAs entry, you should modify this file.  The version
in the EDB file is a (possibly out of date) copy.

Finally it will start listening for associations.

To stop all the diagnostic message you should re-direct the output to
a file, for example, start the DSA with (using /bin/csh)

       % /usr/local/etc/ros.quipu -t ./quiputailor >&/dev/null

You will not need to run this is the background as the process will
detach itself from the terminal and control will return to your shell.

*** Configuring for YOUR country ***

To add a new country create an entry for the top level EDB file to
represent you country (following the other examples e.g., the c=GB entry).
You will also need to add an entry for your DSA to this file
(following the other examples e.g., the cn=Giant Tortoise entry).

When complete, both these entries should be sent via email to
     RFC822:  quipu-support@cs.ucl.ac.uk 
     X.400:   /S=Quipu-Support/OU=CS/O=UCL/PRMD=UK.AC/ADMD=GOLD 400/c=GB/
who currently maintain the MASTER root node of the DIT.


*** UPDATING SLAVES ***

Having registered your DSA and country you will be able to receive
regular updates of the root node of the DIT by setting the variable
   update on
in your quiputailor file.
